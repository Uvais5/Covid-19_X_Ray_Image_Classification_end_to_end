COVID-19 X-Ray Image Classification (End-to-End)This project provides an end-to-end solution for classifying COVID-19 from chest X-ray images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The solution includes a trained model and a user-friendly web application built with Streamlit for easy deployment and interaction.üöÄ Deployed ApplicationYou can try out the live application here:https://uvais5-covid-19-x-ray-image-classification-end-to-en-app-ma1soe.streamlitapp.com/üìñ Medium ArticleFor a detailed explanation of the project, including the CNN architecture, training process, and deployment steps, please refer to the accompanying Medium article:COVID-19 Chest X-Ray Image Classification CNN End-to-End with Streamlit Deployüì∫ YouTube VideoWatch a related video explaining the process:Chest X-Ray Covid-19 Detection | Transfer Learning | Deep Learning | Kaggle | TensorFlow | Python‚ú® FeaturesImage Classification: Classifies chest X-ray images into COVID-19 positive or negative.Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for accurate predictions.Streamlit Web App: Provides an intuitive web interface for uploading images and getting predictions.End-to-End Solution: Covers data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.üõ†Ô∏è InstallationTo set up this project locally, follow these steps:Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/Uvais5/Covid-19_X_Ray_Image_Classification_end_to_end.git
cd Covid-19_X_Ray_Image_Classification_end_to_end
Create a virtual environment (recommended):python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt # (Assuming you have a requirements.txt file)
# If no requirements.txt, you might need to install these:
# pip install tensorflow keras streamlit opencv-python numpy
üöÄ UsageOnce the dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit application:streamlit run app.py # (Assuming your main Streamlit app file is named app.py)
This command will open the web application in your default browser. You can then upload an X-ray image and get the classification result.üß† Model ArchitectureThe project employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed for image classification tasks. The model is trained on a dataset of chest X-ray images to distinguish between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. More details on the specific architecture and training methodology can be found in the Medium article.ü§ù ContributingContributions are welcome!
